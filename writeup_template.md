**The goals / steps of this project are the following:**  

**Training / Calibration**  

* Download the simulator and take data in "Training Mode"
* Test out the functions in the Jupyter Notebook provided
* Add functions to detect obstacles and samples of interest (golden rocks)
* Fill in the `process_image()` function with the appropriate image processing steps (perspective transform, color threshold etc.) to get from raw images to a map.  The `output_image` you create in this step should demonstrate that your mapping pipeline works.
* Use `moviepy` to process the images in your saved dataset with the `process_image()` function.  Include the video you produce as part of your submission.

**Autonomous Navigation / Mapping**

* Fill in the `perception_step()` function within the `perception.py` script with the appropriate image processing functions to create a map and update `Rover()` data (similar to what you did with `process_image()` in the notebook). 
* Fill in the `decision_step()` function within the `decision.py` script with conditional statements that take into consideration the outputs of the `perception_step()` in deciding how to issue throttle, brake and steering commands. 
* Iterate on your perception and decision function until your rover does a reasonable (need to define metric) job of navigating and mapping.  



## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/916/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Notebook Analysis
#### 1. Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with the test data provided, next on data you have recorded). Add/modify functions to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.

Two functions were added to identify the rocks and obstacles:

1- rock_threshed(img, levels =(110,110,70)

![alt text](images/rock_thresh_function.JPG)

2- obs_thresh(img, rgb_thresh=(160,160,160)

![alt text](images/obs_threshed.JPG)

#### 1. Populate the `process_image()` function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a worldmap.  Run `process_image()` on your test data using the `moviepy` functions provided to create video output of your result. 
And another! 

    # 1) Define source and destination points for perspective transform
    # Set a bottom offset to account for the fact that the bottom of the image 
    dst_size = 5
    bottom_offset = 6
    source = np.float32([[14, 140], [301 ,140],[200, 96], [118, 96]])
    destination = np.float32([[image.shape[1]/2 - dst_size, image.shape[0] - bottom_offset],
                  [image.shape[1]/2 + dst_size, image.shape[0] - bottom_offset],
                  [image.shape[1]/2 + dst_size, image.shape[0] - 2*dst_size - bottom_offset], 
                  [image.shape[1]/2 - dst_size, image.shape[0] - 2*dst_size - bottom_offset],
                  ])
    # 2) Apply perspective transform
    warped, mask = perspect_transform(img, source, destination)
    # 3) Apply color threshold to identify navigable terrain/obstacles/rock samples
    threshed = color_thresh(warped)
    obs_map = np.absolute(np.float32(threshed)-1) * mask
    # 4) Convert thresholded image pixel values to rover-centric coords
    xpix, ypix = rover_coords(threshed)
    obsxpix, obsypix = rover_coords(obs_map)
    # create a map of the world 
    world_size = data.worldmap.shape[0]
    # 6) define proper variables for plotting the pixels to the world 
    scale = 2 * dst_size
    xpos = data.xpos[data.count]
    ypos = data.ypos[data.count]
    yaw = data.yaw[data.count]
    # 5) Convert rover-centric pixel values to world coord
    x_world, y_world = pix_to_world(xpix, ypix, xpos, ypos, yaw, world_size, scale)
    obs_x_world, obs_y_world = pix_to_world(obsxpix, obsypix, xpos, ypos, yaw, world_size, scale) 
    # 7) Display the navigable pixels in blue and the obstacle pixels in red  
    data.worldmap[y_world, x_world,2] = 255
    data.worldmap[obs_y_world,obs_x_world,0] = 255
    # 8 ) zero out obstacle pixels that overlap with navigable pixels 
    nav_pix = data.worldmap[:,:,2] > 0
    data.worldmap[nav_pix,0] = 0
    rock_map = rock_thresh(warped, levels =(110,110,50))
    # 9) check for rocks 
    if rock_map.any():
        # Convert rock image pixel values to rover-centric coords
        rock_x,rock_y = rover_coords(rock_map)
        
        rock_x_world,rock_y_world = pix_to_world(rock_x,rock_y,xpos,ypos,yaw,world_size,scale)
        data.worldmap[rock_y_world,rock_x_world,:] = 255     
    # 10 ) Make a mosaic image
    output_image = np.zeros((img.shape[0] + data.worldmap.shape[0], img.shape[1]*2, 3))
    output_image[0:img.shape[0], 0:img.shape[1]] = img
    # Add the warped image in the upper right hand corner
    output_image[0:img.shape[0], img.shape[1]:] = warped
    # Overlay worldmap with ground truth map
    map_add = cv2.addWeighted(data.worldmap, 1, data.ground_truth, 0.5, 0)
    # Flip map overlay so y-axis points upward and add to output_image 
    output_image[img.shape[0]:, 0:data.worldmap.shape[1]] = np.flipud(map_add)

    

### Autonomous Navigation and Mapping

#### 1. Fill in the `perception_step()` (at the bottom of the `perception.py` script) and `decision_step()` (in `decision.py`) functions in the autonomous mapping scripts and an explanation is provided in the writeup of how and why these functions were modified as they were.


#### 2. Launching in autonomous mode your rover can navigate and map autonomously.  Explain your results and how you might improve them in your writeup.  

**Note: running the simulator with different choices of resolution and graphics quality may produce different results, particularly on different machines!  Make a note of your simulator settings (resolution and graphics quality set on launch) and frames per second (FPS output to terminal by `drive_rover.py`) in your writeup when you submit the project so your reviewer can reproduce your results.**

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
